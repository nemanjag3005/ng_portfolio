I am from Serbia, where I finished the 13th Belgrade High School. I have vast experience building projects and pitching start-up business ideas, as I used to be part of teams both as Project Manager and Lead Frontend Developer at the University's entreprenurial Tech Start Club, where I used my experience to solve problems and create interesting projects working with various teams, using professional development tools and methodologies and winning various awards as a result. \n I am currently also VP Marketing at the University's Research in Bioinformatics Club, where I strive to use my digital marketing skills to create an engaging and beautiful presence for the Club on the Web and Social Media.",

I quickly got into learning about JS Frameworks and focused on learning React. Since then, my passion has only grown as I have become proficient in full-stack web and app development, having worked on countless projects as a hobby or for clients. \n In 2021, me and two of my friends who are also passionate about the digital craft decided to create a digital marketing agency. Thus, LAN Digital was born, a start-up where me and my friends would put our skills to use to create a better web representation for Serbian businesses. Since then we also developed our second business idea for the Serbian market - Obuci.rs, a second-hand clothing web platform, the likes of which has not yet existed in the region.",
