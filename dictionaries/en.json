Thus, LAN Digital was born, a start-up where me and my friends would put our skills to use to create a better web representation for Serbian businesses. Since then we also developed our second business idea for the Serbian market - Obuci.rs, a second-hand clothing web platform, the likes of which has not yet existed in the region.",
