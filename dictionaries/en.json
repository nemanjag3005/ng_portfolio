I am a self taught full-stack Web and App Developer and my passion is creating web applications that are both efficient and beautiful.",
    "bio2": "I'm in my fourth year at the University of Calgary, majoring in Bioinformatics and minoring in Computer Science. Over the years I've developed a broad skill set through roles such as Project Manager and Lead Frontend Developer at the University's Tech Start Club, leading to award-winning projects. I also bring my bioinformatics experience to the Riabowol research lab, applying my skills in a dynamic scientific environment and researching cellular senescence. My web development journey began in 2020, evolving into the co-founding of two ventures: LAN Digital, a digital marketing agency, and Obuci.rs, an innovative online second-hand clothing marketplace unique to the Balkan region.",
    "bio3": "I'm currently a fourth-year student pursuing a major in Bioinformatics and a minor in Computer Science at the University of Calgary. Originally from Serbia, I graduated from the 13th Belgrade High School. I have vast experience building projects and pitching start-up business ideas, as I used to be part of teams both as Project Manager and Lead Frontend Developer at the University's entreprenurial Tech Start Club. During my tenure, I used my experience to solve problems and create award-winning projects working with various teams and using professional development tools and methodologies. \n I also serve as the VP of Marketing for the Research in Bioinformatics Club, where  I have blended my digital marketing acumen with a passion for web development, creating a dynamic online presence for the club.",
    "bio3-2": "I started learning web development in 2020, teaching myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and later delving into React and full-stack development. Since then, my passion has only grown as I have become proficient in full-stack web and app development, having worked on countless projects as a hobby or for clients. \n In 2021, me and two of my friends who are also passionate about the digital craft decided to create a digital marketing agency. Thus, LAN Digital was born, a start-up where me and my friends would put our skills to use to create a better web representation for Serbian businesses. Since then we also developed our second business idea for the Serbian market - Obuci.rs, a second-hand clothing web platform, the likes of which has not yet existed in the region.",
    "bio3-3": " Over the last three years of my web development journey, I have gained a tremendous amount of experience from working on serious collaborative projects, personal ventures as well as work for clients.

My skills in bioinformatics have also been put to practical use in the Riabowol research lab, where I currently apply my expertise researching cellular senescence. Outside of my professional pursuits, my hobbies and passions include tennis, travel, personal fitness and motorsport.",
